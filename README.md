## üí° Concept

The preparation of a roundtrip can be long and difficult. Users need to gather all information into one document, which makes you get lost in the process. Users can start there roundtrip unprepared, due to some information being difficult to find as well.

Tripper makes planning a roundtrip to Bali easier. Users can find all important information and fun activities for their trip. Simply select the preferred activities, fill in the length of your trip and Tripper will do the rest. Tripper devides the days over the selected locations and creates a logical route. All activities will be plotted on a map for each location. The locations also come with a day schedule to indicate which activities are best to do.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Product Biography

You can find all the progression of my work documented in my [Product Biography](https://iced-holiday-4d4.notion.site/Productbiografie-f104d24e38464297934699662f349a90?pvs=4).

## üìù Wishlist

For my project there are some parts I wanted to perfect more. For instance, I use OpenAI API to generate the day schedules for each location. Due to the limited free usage for the API, it's proven difficult to perfect the prompt. I hoped to perfect the prompt, but need to get a paid subscription to do so. When the prompt is perfect, I wanted to only display the activities matching the opened day schedule. This would give users a better visual representation of the activities connected to the day.

Since time for the project was running out, some features are left behind. I wanted to create a filter for locations, to make browsing easier. Also, I hoped to make the markers on the activity select page clickable. After clicking, a overview of the selected activities was meant to be displayed. This would give the user more feedback of the selected activities.
